* push_back - inserts an element at the back of the list.  
* push_after - inserts an element after a pointed node. 
* delete - deletes first occurrence of a node with given key. 
* delete_pos - deletes nth node where n is zero indexed.  
* swap - swaps two nodes by link.  
* search - searches for an element.  
* getMid - returns middle element of list.  
* getNode - returns Nth node element of list.  
* getNodeFromEnd - returns Nth node from the end.  
* print - prints contents of the list.
