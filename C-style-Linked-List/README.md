A linked list is an ordered set of data elements, each containing a link to its successor (and sometimes its predecessor). 

Functions:  
* makeNode - creates a data node.  
* push_front - inserts an element at the front of the list.  
* push_back - inserts an element at the back of the list.  
* push_after - inserts an element after a pointed node. 
* delete - deletes first occurrence of a node with given key. 
* delete_pos - deletes nth node where n is zero indexed.  
* print - prints contents of the list.
